    <h1>Content Strategy</h1>
    <p>The pwp will be one page and will have three sections: about me, portfolio, and contact section.</p>
    <h2>About me:</h2>
    <p>The about me section will have two to four sentences that describes who I am and what I can do.  My goal is to keep the section simple and efficient, so I can have the recruiter or hiring manager focus more on my portfolio. I will have a link to resume here in case more information is needed.</p>
    <h2>Portfolio:</h2>
    <p>I want to have the portfolio show the projects I have finished and am working on. Each project will have a picture and a few sentences to describe it. As I get more projects, I want to showcase diverse projects to show off all my skills and preferences. </p>
    <h2>Contact</h2>
    <p>This contains a contact form to my professional email. I will have LinkedIn and Github icons in the header and footer of the webpage as additional methods of contact.</p>

    <h1>Persona</h1>
    <img src="linkedin-sales-navigator-unsplash.jpg" alt="Lady Working">
    <p><strong>Name:</strong>Nicole Osborne</p>
    <p><strong>Age:</strong>42</p>
    <p><strong>Profession:</strong>Nicole is the Hiring Manager for SummitSolutions.com, a recruitment company in Albuquerque specializing in matching tech companies in Albuquerque to web developers. She has seen an increase in demand from startup companies for junior web developers who can do front-end development. </p>
    <p><strong>Technology:</strong>Summit Solutions provides a Pixel 3a cell phone with unlimited 4G data and an HP Chromebook 14 laptop for work. Nicole has an iPhone X and 13-inch MacBook Pro for personal use.</p>
    <p><strong>Attitudes and Behavior:</strong>Nicole uses LinkedIn to find candidates and uses Facebook along with Twitter to make sure a candidate can perform in a professional setting. Her first contact with candidates after vetting them is a phone call to determine a candidates' interest in work. Nicole values having examples of a candidate's work and ease of finding contact information</p>
    <p><strong>Needs and Frustrations:</strong>Nicole needs to find several junior web developers because a startup has received 2 million dollars in venture capital. The junior web developer positions provide generous benefits but provide a salary slightly lower than the average entry level salary in order to entice web developers to stay with the company in the long run. Nicole needs to fill the position within one month, and she found many candidates from around the United States and Albuquerque. Nicole cannot spend more than 10 minutes examining and vetting candidates</p>
    <p><strong>Goals:</strong>Nicole needs to find the ideal candidate:  someone who can do the technical work and will stay with the new company.</p>
    <p><strong>User Story:</strong>As a recruiter user, I need to determine if a candidate will be a good fit for the web developer position.</p>
