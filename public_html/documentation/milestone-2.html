    <h1>Content Strategy</h1>
    <p>The pwp will be one page and will have four sections: profile picture, about me, portfolio, and contact.</p>
    <h2>Profile picture</h2>
    <p>My profile picture will have a professional picture that stretches the row.  I will be on one side of the screen and my name will be opposite of me along with background.</p>
    <h2>About me:</h2>
    <p>The about me section will have two to four sentences that describes who I am and what I can do.  My goal is to keep the section simple and efficient, so I can have the recruiter or hiring manager focus more on my portfolio. I will have a link to resume here in case more information is needed.</p>
    <h2>Portfolio:</h2>
    <p>I want to have the portfolio show the projects I have finished and am working on. Each project will have a picture and a few sentences to describe it. As I get more projects, I want to showcase diverse projects to show off all my skills and preferences. </p>
    <h2>Contact:</h2>
    <p>This contains a contact form to my professional email. I will have LinkedIn and Github icons in the header and footer of the webpage as additional methods of contact.</p>
