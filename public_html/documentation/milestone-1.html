    <h1>Purpose, Audience, Goals</h1>
        <h2>Purpose</h2>
            <p>This project will be a professional portfolio website with a focus on front-end web development.</p>
        <h2>Audience</h2>
            <p>I am designing this web page to target professional I.T. employers. My target audience includes hiring managers, recruiters, and peers in the Albuquerque I.T. and web development community in Albuquerque. </p>
        <h2>Goal</h2>
            <p>This web site has two goals. The first goal is to have users contact me regarding employment and collaboration opportunities using the contact form and the connected social media profiles. The second goal is to increase my online presence by presenting my work. </p>

    <h1>Persona</h1>
    <img src="linkedin-sales-navigator-unsplash.jpg" alt="Lady Working">
    <p><strong>Name:</strong>Nicole Osborne</p>
    <p><strong>Age:</strong>42</p>
    <p><strong>Profession:</strong>Nicole is the Hiring Manager for SummitSolutions.com, a recruitment company in Albuquerque specializing in matching tech companies in Albuquerque to web developers. She has seen an increase in demand from startup companies for junior web developers who can do front-end development. </p>
    <p><strong>Technology:</strong>Summit Solutions provides a Pixel 3a cell phone with unlimited 4G data and an HP Chromebook 14 laptop for work. Nicole has an iPhone X and 13-inch MacBook Pro for personal use.</p>
    <p><strong>Attitudes and Behavior:</strong>Nicole uses LinkedIn to find candidates and uses Facebook along with Twitter to make sure a candidate can perform in a professional setting. Her first contact with candidates after vetting them is a phone call to determine a candidates' interest in work. Nicole values having examples of a candidate's work and ease of finding contact information</p>
    <p><strong>Needs and Frustrations:</strong>Nicole needs to find several junior web developers because a startup has received 2 million dollars in venture capital. The junior web developer positions provide generous benefits but provide a salary slightly lower than the average entry level salary in order to entice web developers to stay with the company in the long run. Nicole needs to fill the position within one month, and she found many candidates from around the United States and Albuquerque. Nicole cannot spend more than 10 minutes examining and vetting candidates</p>
    <p><strong>Goals:</strong>Nicole needs to find the ideal candidate:  someone who can do the technical work and will stay with the new company.</p>
